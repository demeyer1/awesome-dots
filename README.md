# Awesome Dots

> The open-source side of dots: agents you can run yourself, and the pieces every
> dot is made of. A model, a browser, a memory, tools, and a way to reach you.

OpenAI launched [dots](https://openai.com/index/introducing-dots/) on September 29,
2026: always-on agents in ChatGPT, each with its own cloud computer and browser.
This list is about building and running the same idea on your own machine.

## What a dot is made of

- **A model** that decides what to do next.
- **A browser**, because most of the work lives on websites. It is also the part
  that fails most often: OpenAI's own guide says a dot uses your local browser
  [when its cloud browser is blocked](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/20001530-getting-started-with-your-dot).
- **A memory**, so the agent knows what it already did and what you prefer.
- **Tools**, usually over MCP, for everything that has an API.
- **A channel** to reach you: chat, Slack, Telegram, voice.
- **A clock**, so it keeps working when you are not looking.

## Open-source dots

- [open-dots](https://github.com/Anil-matcha/open-dots) - Self-hosted chat with tools, approvals, connectors and computer tasks. Next.js and FastAPI.
- [opendots](https://github.com/diggerhq/opendots) - An always-on personal agent on the model you choose, built on serverless agents.
- [open-dot](https://github.com/composio-community/open-dot) - Personal agents that each get their own browser, memory and rules, with scheduled routines.
- [opendot](https://github.com/defog-ai/opendot) - Runs Codex or Claude Code in a locked-down container and asks before it acts. Slack and CLI.
- [dots](https://github.com/dots-oai/dots) - A goal-driven agent runtime: a planner, an executor and a watcher that keep going between conversations.
- [AgentForEach](https://github.com/AgentForEach/AgentForEach) - A serverless backend for running one agent per user.

## Always-on personal agents

The projects that made the idea popular before dots had a name.

- [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) - A gateway that stays on, with channels, skills and a heartbeat that lets the agent start work on its own.
- [nanobot](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot) - A small Python take on the same idea, with memory, MCP, cron and chat channels.

## The browser

Everything a dot does on the web goes through one. What the site sees is the
browser, not the model.

- [dots](https://github.com/feder-cr/dots) - A web agent with a chat on one side and its live browser on the other, driven by any OpenRouter model, on a patched Firefox engine.
- [invisible_playwright_mcp](https://github.com/feder-cr/invisible_playwright_mcp) - The same browser as an MCP server, for Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI and other clients.
- [browser-use](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use) - A Python library for agents that use the browser.
- [Playwright MCP](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp) - Playwright as an MCP server.
- [Chrome DevTools MCP](https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp) - Chrome DevTools for coding agents.

## Memory

- [mem0](https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0) - A memory layer for agents: what the user said, preferred and asked for, across sessions.

## Tools, skills and plugins

- [Secure MCP Tunnel client](https://github.com/openai/tunnel-client) - Connects an MCP server on your own machine to ChatGPT without exposing it to the internet.
- [ChatGPT developer mode](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/developer-mode) - How to add your own MCP server as a plugin.
